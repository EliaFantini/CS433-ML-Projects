## Project 1: AIcrowd ML Higgs challenge

We implemented a classifier from CERN data to recognize Higgs boson decay signatures, 
using different ML techniques and loss functions, as well as several pre and post-processing techniques.
(Accuracy 82,9% | 49th out of 293 in the AIcrowd leaderboard)

## Project 2: AIcrowd Road Segmentation challenge

We trained a slightly modified version of DeepLabV3+ CNN to recognize roads in aerial 
images (F1 score 91% | 12th out of 107 in the AIcrowd leaderboard)
